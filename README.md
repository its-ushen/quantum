## Description:
The Quantum Simplified is an educational web application designed to introduce fundamental concepts in quantum computing. This project aims to render quantum computing more accessible to students and enthusiasts, providing interactive and informative content. The project comprises several HTML pages, each focusing on a different aspect of quantum computing, augmented by JavaScript for interactivity and navigation alongside CSS for styling.

## Files Overview:

### HTML Files:
- index.html: The landing page of the application. It offers an overview of the project and is a hub for navigating to other sections.
- quantum-algorithms.html: Concentrates on various quantum algorithms and their principles.
- quantum-circuits.html: Addresses quantum circuits with interactive elements.
- quantum-protocols.html: Explains quantum communication protocols.
- real-world.html: Demonstrates real-world applications of quantum computing.

### JavaScript Files:
- carousel.js: Manages the image carousel on the landing page.
- menu.js: Oversees the responsive navigation menu.
- scrolldown.js: Implements smooth scrolling functionality.
- scrollto.js: Enables navigation to specific content sections from the menu.

### CSS Files:
- index.css: Styling for the landing page.
- microinteractions.css: Contains styles for interactive elements and animations across the site.
- quantum-algorithm.css: Styling specifically for the quantum algorithms page.
- quantum-circuit.css: Dedicated styling for the quantum circuits page.
- quantum-protocols.css: Styling for the quantum protocols page.
- real-world.css: Custom styling for the real-world applications page.
## Design Choices:

The decision to use separate HTML pages for each topic was made to keep the content organised and focused. JavaScript was selected for its interactivity, whilst CSS files were created to ensure consistent and appealing styles throughout the site. The use of separate CSS files for each page allows for modular and maintainable styling, facilitating updates and management of the site's design.
